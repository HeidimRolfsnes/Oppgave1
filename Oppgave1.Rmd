Definition: Reproducibility means that you should be able to repeat a
research with the same data and procedures that were used in an article.

The terms reproducibility and replicability are used interchangeably in
scientific circles. Some groups believe that reproducibility means
repeating an investigation in an article using the same data, while
replicability means doing it again, preferably with new data, but
getting the same response. While other groups believe the opposite.
