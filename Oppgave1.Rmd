# Introduction

Definition: Reproducibility means that you should be able to repeat a
research with the same data and procedures that were used in an article.

The terms reproducibility and replicability are used interchangeably in
scientific circles. Some groups believe that reproducibility means
repeating an investigation in an article using the same data, while
replicability means doing it again, preferably with new data, but
getting the same response. While other groups believe the opposite.

## Benefits

As we have writtten about before, we use reproducibility to repeat a
research using the same data but with a separate twist.

Barbara R. Jasny et al. writes in an article that new technology is
constantly emerging, and produces new data in different variants, which
increases the expectations for new knowledge. [@jasny_again_2011]. By
increasing the expectations of the data, we can also see an increase in
the expectations for the content.

Although a test is reproducible, the quality may not be as good.
